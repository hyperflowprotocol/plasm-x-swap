# Plasma Chain Token Research

## Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION

Currently only **XPL (native token)** is confirmed to exist on Plasma chain.

## Required Research:
1. **Find official Plasma token registry**
2. **Verify DyorSwap deployment on Plasma** 
3. **Get real token contract addresses from Plasma explorer**
4. **Find official documentation for Plasma DeFi ecosystem**

## Current Issue:
- Using placeholder token addresses that don't exist on Plasma
- Need to research actual deployed tokens on Plasma chain
- Should only show tokens that actually exist and are tradeable

## Next Steps:
1. Contact Plasma team for token list
2. Check Plasma explorer for verified contracts
3. Research actual DEX deployments on Plasma
4. Update app with real, verified token addresses only
